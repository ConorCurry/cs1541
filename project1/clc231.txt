The branch I'm submitting includes a data cache implementation that had some side
 effects that messed up the previously perfectly matching instruction cache output...
I still have the other version but figure more stuff is implemented on this branch.
Namely some data cache stuff.

So instruction cache reads are slightly off from what they should be, but it isn't
 often too different from the example outputs.

For data caches, write-around on direct mapped caches works. The other combinations
of write/allocate schemes aren't implemented.

Did not get to the extra credit.

Compiled using the gcc options that were provided by the project wiki.

Thanks
